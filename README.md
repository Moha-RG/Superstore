## OVERVIEW
This project helped me practice some powerful visualization techniques and improve the overall user experience 

(1) CLEAN DATA
 remove all null and duplicate values 
 
(2) DATA MODELING
separate the big table to (fact table) and (dimension tables) and
create the relations between them

(3) DATA VISUALIZATION
